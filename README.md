# CS229: Machine Learning Solutions

This repository compiles the problem sets and my solutions to Stanford's Machine Learning graduate class (CS229), taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.

The problems sets are the ones given for the class of Fall 2017.

For each problem set, solutions are provided as an iPython Notebook.

## Problem Set 1: Supervised Learning

The first problem set deals with supervised learning:

## Problem Set 2: Supervised Learning II

The second problem set continues exploring supervised learning:
