# CS229: Machine Learning Solutions

This repository compiles the problem sets and my solutions to Stanford's Machine Learning graduate class (CS229), taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.

The problems sets are the ones given for the class of Fall 2017.

For each problem sets, my solutions are provided as an iPython Notebook.

## Problem Set 1

The first problem set deals with supervised learning:

1. **Excercise 1**: Logistic regression and Newton's method
2. **Excercise 2**: Poisson regression, exponential family
3. **Excercise 3**: Gaussian discriminant analysis
4. **Excercise 4**: Linear invariance of optimization algorithms
5. **Excercise 5**: Regression for denoising quasar spectra
